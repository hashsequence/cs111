wall time vs cpu time

wall time, in real life, alpha 
cpu time, time of cpu, beta

alpha < beta can happen when we have multiple threads
alpha == beta when there is a single thread
alpha > beta when there is overhead from other funtions and io
or when you have a pipe but there is a block for a minute, the cpu time will stop 
but real time continues

2.1.1.1

use a for loop to investigate the list ,  spin lock cost more time on cpu using a normal cpu with 4 cores
on seasnet the mutex is slower than because the cost of creating 16 threads. the spin lock will take waste cpu time, thats why it takes forever the actual should be between 16 to 160 the mutex time 
spinlock should 

q2.2.2
a
the list is lower than the add function
if we check the original result the cost is much higher than the add function
obviously list operations are much longer than add so should have higher cost 
per operation

========================================================================

2.3.1 
most of the cycles should be spent in th elocks for 1 and 2 threads tests, 
but no actual data, so they are roughly equal, 

for high thread and spin locks i believe most of the cycles are spent in
the locks because a spin lock keeps spinning until its unlock

for a mutex most of the time is spent in the mutex lock, if you cant get a lock you are put into a queue and wait 

if there are a lot threads each threads has less operatinos to do, but 
what is the average cost per operation

2.3.2 
threads competing for locks

why does the completion time 

how is the wait time larger than completion time
completetion is time per operation

2.3.4

more threads less throughput
