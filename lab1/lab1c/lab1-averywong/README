some limitations to this code is that I there might be some obscure error cases i didnt account for.
IF the child process never returns then simpsh wille hang forever, but I already account for closing
all the file descriptors before waitpid

lab1c:
I have included the following in my file:
lab1c.c
README
Makefile
testscript.sh
lab1cbenchmark.pdf

the tests were used for my benchmartk, I copied all the data into data.txt.
All my benchmarks were run on lnxsrv09.

For timing I used /usr/bin/time to get the extra usage data from 
bash and dash scripts which I learned from the man pages

Also the total of parent and child process timesd b is what I used for the benchmark times

In my pdf I wrote a note at the end, which should be disregarded because I didnt know you didnt
have to include my testscripts so I removed them
