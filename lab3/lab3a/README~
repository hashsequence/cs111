To check my output I basically used the diff command with the sample 
solution csv files 

basically I put all the sample solutions into a directory then
ran a script:

diff -u <my.csv> <sample.csv>

and check if it was the same

In my code, to make things more readable I wrote 6 functions that parses
the given disk image into the required 6 csv files so it would be more readable

There are some limitations to this code as I assume the block offset was
always 1024 and that I did not cover all possible test cases.

My main method to parse the disk image was create a struct that 
was similar to the one in ext2.h and that I used pread 
to read the data to the struct.

The hard part was getting the correct offset, especially with
the indirect block pointers, but I realized that the address
stored in the block pointers indicated the block number so I just
multiplied the block size by the block nunmber to the required 
offset.

In the code you might see that I had a for loop that uses a bitmask
to read each bit as pread can only read at least one byte at a time, and I 
did not try to read the whole block at once as I wanted to read into
the struct so I can print the variables more easily. So my implementation
was more focused on readibility of code rather than optimization.

In my tarball I have the following:

lab3a.c : is the module source code

Makefile:
	You my notice there are the "mt" and td" options
	that were used to test the disk-image and run
	my diff -u script, so those options won't work
	unless you have the specific files already in 
	your working directory
	
	make dist creates the tarball with lab3a.c Makefile and README
	make clean deletes csv files and lab3a executable
	make compiles lab3a.c
